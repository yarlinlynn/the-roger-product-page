# The Roger Sneaker Page Clone (Inspired by ON & CodeGrid)

This project is a responsive product detail page inspired by the **"The Roger" collection page from ON**:  
🔗 https://www.on.com/en-ch/collection/the-roger

My goal is to recreate the clean, professional look and feel of the original ON sneaker product layout, using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript** with **GSAP animations**.

The idea is to enhance the static design with interactive animations and page transitions inspired by a YouTube tutorial by CodeGrid:

<br/>

## ✅ Features

- Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS
- Horizontally scrolling image carousel on desktop
- Stacked layout on mobile for performance and accessibility
- Clean product details (title, color, price, CTA)
- Related sneaker recommendations below product info
- **Remote image linking** (from ON’s site) to reduce local asset load
- Basic entry animations using GSAP

<br/>

## 🌐 Image Optimization Strategy

To improve performance and reduce project size, all product and recommendation images are linked directly from **ON’s official website** rather than downloaded and hosted locally.

### Benefits:
- ✅ Faster page load with no image hosting setup
- ✅ Reduced project size for easier deployment
- ✅ Immediate access to high-resolution, optimized images
- ✅ Easier updates by simply replacing the URLs

This keeps the project lightweight and efficient, especially when deployed online.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

<br/>

## 💡 Inspired By

### 🎯 Original Product Page (ON)
- **Website**: https://www.on.com/en-ch/collection/the-roger  
- Clean, modern sneaker layout with product carousel and structured recommendations.

### 🎥 Draggable Page Idea (CodeGrid YouTube)
- **Video**: https://youtu.be/CXpY4wHsSCk  
- Implements GSAP + Draggable for a smooth homepage interaction and transition between product pages.

I plan to use this draggable concept in a future homepage that allows users to horizontally drag through products and click to enter the individual product page (this one).

<br/>

## 🔮 Future Features
- [ ] **GSAP-animated draggable homepage** similar to the CodeGrid tutorial
- [ ] Smooth page transitions between homepage and product page
- [ ] Shopping cart drawer with animation
- [ ] Product image zoom or lightbox view
- [ ] Multi-product support using dynamic data (e.g., JSON or CMS)
- [ ] Accessibility enhancements (keyboard nav, ARIA roles)
- [ ] Basic product filtering on homepage (e.g., color, price)
